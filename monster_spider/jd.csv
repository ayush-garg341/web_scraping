An idea from the employee as to any specific companies should be targeted.  Hunt for the candidate begins with a 360 approach, i.e. through databases, referrals, advertisements, Head hunting.  Once the pool of prospective employers is generated the extensive screening process at our end starts vis a vis the job requirements, personal and professional skills needed so that the employer does not face any problem with the employee in future.  Then the profiles are recommended to the prospective employers and we coordinate the interview  Once the employer accepts the candidate as an employee there is a mechanism of being constantly in touch with the Employee check on the satisfaction levels and any arising is brought to the notice of the employer.    In all our recruitment philosophy is a 360 approach to selling an employer to an employee and vice versa, Cautious enough not to undersell or oversell anyone and making the facts as it is available to each so that the relationship of theirs last longer.   Team  Our people come to us with intellect, knowledge and energy. We instill in them both passion and a commitment to work effectively.

During the process, they consider several factors. For example, in developing an industrial robot, engineers specify the functional requirements precisely; design and test the robot's components; integrate the components to produce the final design; and evaluate the design's overall effectiveness, cost, reliability, and safety. This process applies to the development of many different products, such as chemicals, computers, powerplants, helicopters, and toys. In addition to their involvement in design and development, many engineers work in testing, production, or maintenance. These engineers supervise production in factories, determine the causes of a components failure, and test manufactured products to maintain quality. They also estimate the time and cost required to complete projects. Supervisory engineers are responsible for major components or entire projects.  Engineers use computers extensively to produce and analyze designs; to simulate and test how a machine, structure, or system operates; to generate specifications for parts; to monitor the quality of products; and to control the efficiency of processes. Nanotechnology, which involves the creation of high-performance materials and components by integrating atoms and molecules, also is introducing entirely new principles to the design process.

Data Center Support Specialist,A V Immigration And Careers Consultancy Private Limited," Keywords / Skills :  all engineer , Senior Engineer Dsp Software, electrical engineer , mechanical engneer , electronics engineer .","Job Description   Task :  Many engineers develop new products. During the process, they consider several factors. For example, in developing an industrial robot, engineers specify the functional requirements precisely; design and test the robot's components; integrate the components to produce the final design; and evaluate the design's overall effectiveness, cost, reliability, and safety. This process applies to the development of many different products, such as chemicals, computers, powerplants, helicopters, and toys. In addition to their involvement in design and development, many engineers work in testing, production, or maintenance. These engineers supervise production in factories, determine the causes of a components failure, and test manufactured products to maintain quality. They also estimate the time and cost required to complete projects. Supervisory engineers are responsible for major components or entire projects.  Engineers use computers extensively to produce and analyze designs; to simulate and test how a machine, structure, or system operates; to generate specifications for parts; to monitor the quality of products; and to control the efficiency of processes. Nanotechnology, which involves the creation of high-performance materials and components by integrating atoms and molecules, also is introducing entirely new principles to the design process.
